                           <p>Dear Investigator,</p>
                           <p>The ICH E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practices (May 1996) requires that the sponsor of a clinical trial notify Regulatory Authorities and all participating investigators, in a written report, of any serious adverse event that is reasonably associated with the use of the investigational product (the tested IP or an active comparator) and is “unexpected”, i.e., the nature, severity, or outcome of which is not consistent with the current reference document (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure).</p>
                           <p>This letter with the attached safety report(s) serves as your notification. Please note that it may also serves as your notification in case a SUSAR is downgraded.</p>
                           <p>In placebo-controlled open trials, no notification letters to investigators are written for serious adverse events that are reported with the use of placebo, unless if related to placebo’s excipient. Therefore, no inference should be made about the incidence of such events on placebo.</p>
                           <p>In placebo-controlled blind trials, notification letters to investigators will be released for serious adverse events with the use all investigational medicinal products including the use of placebo.</p>
                           <p>Please note that, according to your applicable local regulation, you may be required to promptly inform your Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee of this/these event(s). If so, we provide you the following information to assist in your review/decision:</p>
                                <ol>
                                  <li>The event(s) is/are considered reasonably associated with the use of the investigational product.</li>
                                  <li>The event(s) is/are “unexpected”, as per the current reference document.</li>
                                  <li>As a result of this/these event(s), if during additional investigations there is a change in the product safety profile assessment leading to a need for further actions - such as amending the protocol by changing the inclusion and exclusion criteria or by introducing additional safety monitoring procedures or by amending the patient information and consent or the Investigator’s Brochure –, it would be duly communicated to you.</li>
                               </ol>
                           <p>Sanofi also routinely performs ongoing review of safety information received from all sources, and will inform you if any changes to the clinical program are warranted based on these reviews.</p>
                           <p>A copy of this/these safety report(s), as well as your IRB/IEC correspondence and IRB Adverse Event Reporting policy must be retained in your protocol study file and made available for review by the study monitors, company auditors, and applicable regulatory inspectors.</p>
                           <p>The information contained herein is not a conclusion of the Sponsor that the safety report constitutes an admission that the named investigational product caused or contributed to an adverse experience.</p>
                           <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
